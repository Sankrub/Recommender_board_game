# Your Application Name: BoardGame Recommender

## Description
This application is designed to recommend board games based on user preferences. It takes in a range of desired player count, age, and playtime, then recommends the top 10 games fitting those criteria. It can also provide the top 30 games based on average rating, irrespective of the user's preferences.

The core logic of the recommendation is built on a `Data` class that handles data filtering and ranking. Additionally, a `Graph` class is used for data visualization.

## Data Sources
The application uses a CSV file as its primary data source. This CSV file, `boardgames1.csv`, contains a comprehensive list of board games along with various attributes such as minimum players, maximum players, minimum age, minimum playtime, maximum playtime, and average rating.

## Running the Application
To run this application, you will need Python 3 and the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tkinter
- pillow

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application by executing the main Python script in your terminal.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Design
The application is designed with two main classes: `Data` and `Graph`.

- The `Data` class is responsible for reading the data from the CSV file, filtering the data based on user input, and providing recommendations.
- The `Graph` class is used for generating different types of plots for data visualization.

## Design Patterns Used
The application doesn't explicitly use any specific design pattern, but it does follow good object-oriented programming practices by encapsulating data manipulation and visualization logic within separate classes.

## Graph Algorithm Used
While the application doesn't explicitly model any problems as a graph problem, it uses ranking and filtering algorithms for recommending games based on user input and game rankings.

## Other Information
This project was a great opportunity to learn and apply data manipulation and visualization techniques using pandas and matplotlib. It provides a practical application of data analysis in the context of game recommendations, which can be further expanded and refined to include more complex criteria and machine learning algorithms.
